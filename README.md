**Problem Statement:1**
A company wants to predict employee productivity scores to improve workforce planning and training programs. You are hired as a Data Scientist to build a multivariate linear regression model that predicts an employee’s Productivity Score based on multiple work-related factors. 

Experience (yrs),Training Hours,Working Hours,Projects,Productivity Score 

2,40,38,3,62 

5,60,42,6,78 

1,20,35,2,55 

8,80,45,8,88 

4,50,40,5,72 

10,90,48,9,92 

3,30,37,4,65 

6,70,44,7,82 

7,75,46,7,85 

2,25,36,3,60 

Interpretation:
Which factor most strongly impacts productivity?
How does training affect productivity? 
Should the company increase training hours or working hours? 
What happens if Working Hours increase beyond optimal limits? 
Can productivity ever decrease with more experience? 
How would you detect overfitting in this model? 
Suggest one new feature to improve prediction accuracy. 

**Problem Statement:2 **
A financial institution wants to predict whether a customer will default on a loan before approving it. Early identification of risky customers helps reduce financial loss. 

You are working as a Machine Learning Analyst and must build a classification model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict loan default. 

This case introduces: 

Mixed feature types 

Financial risk interpretation 

Class imbalance awareness 

Age,AnnualIncome(lakhs),CreditScore(300-900), LoanAmount(lakhs), LoanTerm(years), EmploymentType, loan(yes/no) 

28,6.5,720,5,5,Salaried,0 

45,12,680,10,10,Self-Employed,1 

35,8,750,6,7,Salaried,0 

50,15,640,12,15,Self-Employed,1 

30,7,710,5,5,Salaried,0 

42,10,660,9,10,Salaried,1 

26,5.5,730,4,4,Salaried,0 

48,14,650,11,12,Self-Employed,1 

38,9,700,7,8,Salaried,0 

55,16,620,13,15,Self-Employed,1 

  

Interpretation:
Identify high-risk customers. 
What patterns lead to loan default? 
How do credit score and income influence predictions? 
Suggest banking policies based on model output. 
Compare KNN with Decision Trees for this problem. 
What happens if LoanAmount dominates distance calculation? 
Should KNN be used in real-time loan approval systems?  

**Problem Statement : 3  **
Write a Python program to draw (visualize) the architecture of a Neural Network used to classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent credit card transactions.  

Assume the fraud detection dataset contains the following input features: 

TransactionAmount 
TransactionTime 
MerchantCategory 
CustomerAge 
AccountBalance 
NumberOfTransactionsToday 
Fraud (0 = Genuine, 1 = Fraud) 

  

**Problem Statement:4 **

Write a Python program to draw a 3D plot that visualizes the regression model for house price prediction using suitable Python-based 3D plotting libraries. 
 Assume the following features were used: 
Area (sq ft) 
Number of Bedrooms 
House Price   

**Problem 5- PROJECT + Presentation  ** 

This is the case; you must develop using LLM and RAG. After submission you people must present to some of the panel members. 

 Use case: “Policy & Claims Copilot” (Customer support + Claims pre-check) 

Goal - Help customers, agents, and claims teams get instant, consistent answers about: 

what’s covered / not covered 

limits & sub-limits 

waiting periods 

claim submission steps + timelines 

documents needed 
…and also do a pre-check of a claim scenario before submission. 

This reduces call center load, speeds claim filing, and improves first-time-right submissions. 

  

Why RAG is needed (vs plain LLM) 

A plain LLM might “guess” policy terms. With RAG, the assistant: 

retrieves the exact relevant clauses from the policy PDF 

answers using only those clauses 

quotes/links the source section/page (grounded response)
